# Functionality 
-We can create a todo 
-We can update a todo 
-We can delete a todo

-The created todo will have createdAt:date/time => this is to make a dashboard route (page) and we will create
  a chart that will illustrate the activity by the time it is created. Therefore we will need the createdAt.
